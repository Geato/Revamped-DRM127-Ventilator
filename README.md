Revamped-DRM127-Ventilator
==========================

>   This is an Altium version of the popular NXP (Freescale) ventilator design
>   note which is \~10 years old now. The component designators are not the same
>   as the original design because I have added and removed some components. I
>   have tried switching as many components to SMT as possible.

>   The biggest change is the LCD display is mounted on the “back” of the PCB so
>   the electronics are all on one board. I have included a mechanical drawing
>   which should help in making panel cutouts / holes.

>   I cannot take any responsibility for any design issues nor can I assume any
>   liability for the operation or safety of this design.

>   The LCD should be mounted on a 0.125” or 3.18mm standoff. To make electrical
>   connection, you can use a header like this one:
>   <https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/samtec-inc/TS-116-G-A/1105446>

>   Neither of these two parts are listed on the BOM.
